# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
# Notice we named the feature array X and response variable y: This is in accordance with the common scikit-learn practice.
# Note the use of .drop() to drop the target variable 'party' from the feature array X as well as the use of the .values attribute to ensure X and y are NumPy arrays. 
# Without using .values, X and y are a DataFrame and Series respectively; 
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors =6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)
